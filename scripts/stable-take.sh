#
# stable is a branch of its own (scripts/release-stable.sh): it takes from main
# what is ready and leaves the rest. A package directory or .github/ is copied
# over in one commit on top of origin/stable, its message naming the main commit
# it came from; --all is a real merge. Nothing goes live by this — the push
# builds stable, a release tag publishes it.
#
# Every package here carries a hand-written PKG_VERSION, so a directory taken
# from main is releasable as it stands (the modem feed has stack packages where
# that is not true). Ordinary `git cherry-pick -x <commit>` onto stable stays
# just as fine.
#
# Works in a temporary worktree: the current checkout is never touched. -y
# pushes without asking.
