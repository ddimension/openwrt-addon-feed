# Publish the package trees one feed build produced — without building again.
#
#   publish-feed.sh <run-id>                                    # a finished build run
#   publish-feed.sh --dir DIR --channel C --sha SHA [--run ID] [--tag T]  # trees already on disk
#
# The first form downloads the run's repo-* artifacts (gh CLI) and takes the
# channel and commit from the run itself; that is the repair path when a build
# went through and only its publish failed. The second form is what the build
# workflow's publish job calls with the artifacts it downloaded — one publish
# path for both.
#
# main publishes from a push to the main branch; stable ONLY from a release
# tag (YYYY.MM.DD[.N], scripts/release-stable.sh) — a push to the stable branch
# builds and publishes nothing. Every <release>/<arch>/packages.adb found is
# published; a leg that has none keeps its published state (publish-pages.sh
# guards that too). There is no pre-channel mirror <release>/<arch>/ in this
# repo: it was split off after the channels existed, so no device follows one.
#
# A late publish must never roll a channel back, so this refuses (with a
# warning, exit 0) when main has moved on since the run, or when the release
# tag no longer points at the run's commit or a newer release tag exists.
#
# Why it exists: a feed build takes hours (16 legs, boost and hostapd in every
# one of them), the artifacts stay attached to the run for 30 days, and a failed
# publish should cost minutes, not another build.
#
# Versions: each published tree keeps the last KEEP_VERSIONS [10] versions of
# every package, so a device can go back (apk add <pkg>=<version>).
# publish-pages.sh does the merging and rebuilds the signed index for it.
#
# Env: KEEP_VERSIONS [10], GH_TOKEN (push credentials; defaults to `gh auth token`),
#      GITHUB_REPOSITORY [ddimension/openwrt-addon-feed]. PAGES_* pass through to
#      publish-pages.sh (PAGES_REMOTE for a dry run against a bare repo).
